## Design Principles
* **Quick to get going.**  EZ-Template should make it easy to learn and use.  Anything is achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write.  
* **Intuitive.**  Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at an EZ-Template project or adding new features.  It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of.  
* **Sensible Defaults.**  Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users, but only with the option to override them.  

We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it.  We're dedicating effort to creating tutorials and documentation with the hope that reading it will gain the user a deeper understanding of the tool, and become even more proficient in using it.
